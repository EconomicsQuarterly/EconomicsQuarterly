    <p>“Economics Quarterly” is an insightful and masterfully put-together magazine about finance, investing, and
      the global economy, where issues are released regularly with events throughout the year. We are expanding
      and recruiting members to further the magazine, with positions from five teams on offer: Administrations,
      Articles, Layout, Marketing and Interview/Editing. Some teams such as Articles have more spots than
      others, and leadership positions are considered and offered on an ad hoc basis. You can submit the form
      more than once if you are applying to multiple positions.</p>
    <p>Positions are open to all members of the CIS community. By applying yourself to be involved in the creation
      of the magazine, you are committing yourself to making high quality content. Interview times will be
      notified
      a week after the closure of this form.</p>
