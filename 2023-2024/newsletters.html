        <div class="news-body">
            <p>Just a few days ago (April 24th), a producer of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRNA) and
                the world-famous artificial intelligence leader OpenAI announced their collaboration for further
                integration of AI into Moderna’s research and development endeavors. Stéphane Bancel, CEO of Moderna
                declared that he was “obsessed with ChatGPT since it was released” and wanted company employees to use
                it at least 20 times a day. Ever since Moderna and OpenAI’s initial partnership in 2023 with the launch
                of the custom trained chatbot mChat, Moderna has utilized more than 750 generative pre-trained models to
                automate various parts of its operations. The usage of artificial intelligence to handle routine,
                entry-level tasks such as selecting dosages for clinical trials allows employees to focus their
                attention elsewhere on more important matters: the creation of their 15 prospective mRNA medicines for
                major diseases such as cancer and HIV. Artificial intelligence allows for the dramatic reduction in the
                need for extensive human capital while simultaneously accelerating processes and minimizing time
                investment. Stéphane Bancel remarked that “If we had to do it the old biopharmaceutical ways, we might
                need a hundred thousand people today”, a 1700% increase from its 2023 employee count of 5600.</p>
            <p>After Moderna lost billions in 2023 due to their sharp drop in COVID-19 vaccine sales along with the end
                of the COVID-19 pandemic, their share price continued to decline into the double digits, a long way off
                from their $497 all time high in 2021. They have seen persistent and consistent declines in quarterly
                revenue and gross profit. Only recently in 2024 has it finally climbed back above the $100 mark.</p>
            <p>A multitude of companies have witnessed their share price soar and the rapid growth that followed their
                integration of artificial intelligence into their business in the AI-fueled bull market. Any startup
                company championing a business model integrating AI into traditional business processes can spur
                billions of dollars of investment. For Moderna, this partnership with one of if not the most prominent
                AI companies in the world will most certainly be a lifesaver.</p>

            <p>The Federal Reserve has recently announced to <a
                    href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20240501.pdf">keep
                interest rates unchanged</a> in their latest (April 30 - May 1) meeting. The Federal Reserve (or “The
                Fed”) is the US central bank. It controls economic growth and keeps inflation in check by influencing
                the level of interest rates. Generally, when the Fed raises rates, growth cools and inflation drops.
                When the Fed cuts rates, growth picks up and inflation rises.</p>
            <p>Fed policy is one of the most – if not the most – important things the markets monitor closely. And
                lately, US monetary policy has been a rollercoaster. 2022, with unprecedented geopolitical turmoil and
                supply chain bottlenecks, saw some of the highest US inflation in years. To keep this skyrocketing
                inflation in check and prevent it from going out of control, the Fed has kept policy tight, i.e.,
                <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/fed-funds-rate-history/">interest rates have remained
                    very high</a> for the past two years.</p>
            <p>As 2023 ended the year strong with signs of stubborn inflation finally starting to come down,
                expectations began to simmer that after two long years, the Fed would finally cut rates, ending its
                tightening policy regime at last.</p>
            <p>Estimates ranged from rate cuts coming <a
                    href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-17/the-case-for-two-fed-rate-cuts-in-early-2024-is-building">early
                in 2024</a>, as early as even January, while more modest estimates predicted a <a
                    href="https://www.morningstar.com/markets/when-will-fed-start-cutting-interest-rates">rate cut
                in June 2024</a>. Either way, pretty much everyone agreed that rate cuts this year were certain. People
                tried to capitalize on this policy direction in many ways, such as with <a
                        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullsteepener.asp">fixed-income trades</a> designed
                to profit from a flattening yield curve and rising bond prices.</p>
            <p>Yet in the first three months of 2024, this hype faded abruptly as bumpy inflation data came in <a
                    href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/10/economy/cpi-consumer-price-index-inflation-march/index.html">higher
                than expected</a>, casting doubts on whether inflation was actually on a cooling trend. With inflation
                being still too high, the Fed did not cut rates.</p>
            <p>Having been proved wrong, the market’s expectations quickly swung to the other side – all of a sudden,
                people were questioning whether there would be any rate cuts in 2024 at all. <a
                        href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/11/economy/fed-interest-rate-hike-probability/index.html">Worries
                    of another rate increase</a> even started to surface. This drastic subversion of market expectations
                contributed significantly to the late-2023 early-2024 stock market rally ending in April, dropping to
                late February levels. However, with a downside surprise in first-quarter growth, and financial services
                and goods inflation showing signs of lowering, the markets still recognize that even though rate cuts
                are not as certain to occur as before, they are still possible, and according to some, <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyUPsEU23Yc">quite likely</a>.</p>
            <p>The main takeaway here is that it’s not so much what actually happens, but rather what people expect to
                happen that matters for markets. Interest rates have been unchanged so far this year, but due to
                people’s expectations for interest rates changing up and down so drastically, markets have reacted
                drastically in response as well.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="news-body">
            <p>Recently, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has made an interesting decision in raising the interest rate for the
                first time in 17 years from a negative 0.1 percent base rate to a positive interest rate: the last
                economy to have a negative interest rate in the world has finally hiked its rates, sending a clear
                signal to the rest of the world.</p>
            <p>The peculiar combination of monetary policies in Japan is largely due to the burst of the asset price
                bubble in 1991, after which a period of economic stagnation ensued. Referred to as the “Lost Decade”,
                even after the official end of this period economic growth faced difficulties and inflation levels
                remained low. Under these conditions, BOJ imposed numerous measures in order to stimulate economic
                growth, such as quantitative easing and negative interest rates. Both of these measures encourage
                borrowing, spending and investing, attempting to revitalize the economy. With the inflation target being
                met for the last few years, BOJ has decided to abolish these aggressive monetary policies.</p>
            <p>This decision has immediate impacts on Japan’s domestic economy. One of the most significant is an
                increase in capital inflow into Japan: while Yen interest rates rise, overseas investments become less
                attractive compared to domestic investments in Japan, resulting in a decrease in carry trades. With
                Japan having the highest net foreign assets amounting to 418 trillion yen in 2022, it can be better
                rephrased as a Yen reflow, where overseas investments start moving back into Japan.</p>
            <p>Theoretically, this should have two implications: as the two largest destinations for Japan’s capital are
                North America and Europe, the policy affects the markets negatively. With Yen reflowing back into Japan,
                this would also mean an appreciation in Japanese Yen. However, this has not been the case with Yen
                depreciating after the announcement of the policy. This counter-intuitive market behaviour is explained
                by force at which BOJ has decided to hike rates; the market has long anticipated a policy change, and
                BOJ’s small hike has indicated its cautious attitude towards further interest rate adjustments in the
                future.</p>
            <p>The policies’ mid to long term impacts can be larger than its current. It would increase the yield of
                Japan bonds, while US treasuries may also increase in yield due to less demand. The overall effect on
                Japan’s stock market remains unknown: while capital inflow and inflation benefits the market, interest
                rate hikes suppress economic activity and export.</p>
